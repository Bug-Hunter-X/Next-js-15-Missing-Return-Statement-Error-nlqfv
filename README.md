# Next.js 15 Missing Return Statement Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when upgrading to Next.js 15: a missing return statement in a functional component. Next.js 15 enforces stricter rules regarding implicit returns, leading to errors if a return statement is omitted.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You will observe an error message in your console indicating a missing return statement in `pages/about.js`.

## Solution

The solution is simply to add an explicit `return` statement to the `About` component, even if it's just returning `null`.

The corrected `pages/aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution. 

This issue highlights the importance of reviewing your functional components after upgrading to Next.js 15, ensuring that all components have explicit `return` statements.
